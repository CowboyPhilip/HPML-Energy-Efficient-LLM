Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because equations can be tricky, especially with negative numbers and all, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the left side of the equation as much as possible. The left side has two terms with 'd' and some constants. Let me write it down again: -282*d + 929 - 178. I think I can combine the constants 929 and -178 first because they don't have 'd' in them.\n\nSo, 929 minus 178. Let me do that subtraction. 929 minus 100 is 829, then minus another 78 is 829 - 78. Hmm, 829 minus 70 is 759, and then minus 8 more is 751. So, 929 - 178 equals 751. Okay, so now the equation simplifies to -282*d + 751 = -1223.\n\nNow, I need to get all the constants on one side and the variable term on the other. So, I should subtract 751 from both sides to get rid of it on the left. Let me write that down: -282*d + 751 - 751 = -1223 - 751. Simplifying that, the left side becomes -282*d, and the right side is -1223 minus 751.\n\nLet me calculate -1223 minus 751. Hmm, 1223 plus 751 is... let's see, 1200 + 700 is 1900, 23 + 51 is 74, so total is 1974. But since both numbers are negative, it's -1974. So, the equation now is -282*d = -1974.\n\nOkay, so now I have -282*d equals -1974. I need to solve",
