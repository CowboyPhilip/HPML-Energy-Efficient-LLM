The goal is to remove the first and last occurrence of that character from the string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the cases where the character might not be present at all. For example, if the string is \"abcda\" and the character is \"a\", then removing the first and last \"a\" would leave \"bcd\". So, I need to handle cases where the character isn't found.\n\nWait, but what if the character appears more than twice? Like in \"hello\", if the character is 'l', the first occurrence is at index 1, and the last is at index 4. So removing both would leave \"heo\". So the function should remove the first and last occurrence, regardless of their positions.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if the character is present in the string.\n2. If it's not present, return the original string.\n3. If it is present, find the first and last occurrence indices.\n4. Slice the string to exclude these two characters.\n\nHow do I find the first and last occurrence? I can use the string's find method. The first occurrence is s.find(char), which returns the index if found, else -1. Similarly, the last occurrence can be found using rfind, which returns the index from the end.\n\nWait, but what if the character appears only once? Then, the first and last would be the same index, so slicing would result in an empty string. That's correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Get the first index: first = s.find(char)\n- Get the last index: last = s.rfind(char)\n- If first == -1, return s\n- Else, return s[:first] + s[last+1:]\n\nWait, but what if the first and last are the same? Like in the case where the string is \"aaaaa\" and the character is 'a'. Then first is 0, last is 4. So s[:0] is empty, and s[5] is beyond the string, so s[last+1:] is s[5:], which is empty. So the result is empty string, which is correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: remove_Occ(\"hello\", \"l\") should return \"heo\".\nFirst is 1,",
